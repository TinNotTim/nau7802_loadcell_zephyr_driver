      DRDY pin

      This pin defaults to active high when produced by the sensor.
      The property value should ensure the flags properly describe
      the signal that is presented to the driver.

      The interrupt pin of NAU7802 is default active high.
  conversions-per-second:
    
    type: int
    default: 0
    # Note: the driver relies on the ordering of this enum,
    # so change it with care.    
    description: |
      Number of force readings performed by the NAU7802 per second.
      10 conversions per second is the power-on reset configuration.
    enum: 
      - 10 # SPS
      - 20 #SPS
      - 40 #SPS
      - 80 #SPS
      - 320 #SPS
  gain:
    type: int
    default: 1    
    description: |
      ADC gain factor. The default value is x1 at power on.

  #   description: |
  #     The sensor model of loadcell is 'y = ax + b'. The calibration factor is the 'a', and should be measured before-hand.
